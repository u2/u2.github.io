Voting
******

The following contract is quite complex, but showcases
a lot of Solidity's features. It implements a voting
contract. Of course, the main problems of electronic
voting is how to assign voting rights to the correct
persons and how to prevent manipulation. We will not
solve all problems here, but at least we will show 
how delegated voting can be done so that vote counting
is **automatic and completely transparent** at the
same time.

The idea is to create one contract per ballot,
providing a short name for each option.
Then the creator of the contract who serves as
chairperson will give the right to vote to each
address individually.

The persons behind the addresses can then choose
to either vote themselves or to delegate their
vote to a person they trust.

At the end of the voting time, `winningProposal()`
will return the proposal with the largest number
of votes.

Possible Improvements
=====================

Currently, many transactions are needed to assign the rights
to vote to all participants. Can you think of a better way?

Blind Auction
*************

In this section, we will show how easy it is to create a
completely blind auction contract on Ethereum.
We will start with an open auction where everyone
can see the bids that are made and then extend this
contract into a blind auction where it is not
possible to see the actual bid until the bidding
period ends.

Simple Open Auction
===================

The general idea of the following simple auction contract
is that everyone can send their bids during
a bidding period. The bids already include sending
money / ether in order to bind the bidders to their
bid. If the highest bid is raised, the previously
highest bidder gets her money back.
After the end of the bidding period, the
contract has to be called manually for the
beneficiary to receive his money - contracts cannot
activate themselves.

            // transaction with invalid data is sent to
            // the contract or just ether without data.
            // We revert the send so that no-one
            // accidentally loses money when using the
            // contract.
            throw;
        }
    }

Blind Auction
================

The previous open auction is extended to a blind auction
in the following. The advantage of a blind auction is
that there is no time pressure towards the end of
the bidding period. Creating a blind auction on a
transparent computing platform might sound like a
contradiction, but cryptography comes to the rescue.

During the **bidding period**, a bidder does not
actually send her bid, but only a hashed version of it.
Since it is currently considered practically impossible
to find two (sufficiently long) values whose hash
values are equal, the bidder commits to the bid by that.
After the end of the bidding period, the bidders have
to reveal their bids: They send their values
unencrypted and the contract checks that the hash value
is the same as the one provided during the bidding period.

Another challenge is how to make the auction
**binding and blind** at the same time: The only way to
prevent the bidder from just not sending the money
after he won the auction is to make her send it
together with the bid. Since value transfers cannot
be blinded in Ethereum, anyone can see the value.

The following contract solves this problem by
accepting any value that is at least as large as
the bid. Since this can of course only be checked during
the reveal phase, some bids might be **invalid**, and
this is on purpose (it even provides an explicit
flag to place invalid bids with high value transfers):
Bidders can confuse competition by placing several
high or low invalid bids.
